1. High-Level Organization (Your dev Folder)
The first rule is to have one main folder on your computer where all your code lives. This keeps you organized. A common name is dev.
Your local structure will look like this as you add more projects. Each project is its own separate Git repository.
Generated code
      /Users/your-username/
└── dev/
    ├── agenticml/          (This is a Git repository)
    ├── my-second-project/  (This is another Git repository)
    └── my-portfolio/       (And another one...)
    
2. The Ideal Project Folder Structure
Inside a single project, a good general-purpose structure is essential.
Generated code
      my-project-name/
├── .git/               # Hidden folder created by Git for version control
├── docs/               # Documentation files (guides, specs, etc.)
├── src/                # "Source" code. The heart of your application.
├── tests/              # Automated tests for your code
├── data/               # Sample data, CSV files, etc. (for data projects)
├── assets/             # Images, fonts, sound files, etc. (for web projects)
|
├── .gitignore          # A list of files/folders for Git to ignore (like secrets)
├── LICENSE             # The project's license file (e.g., MIT)
└── README.md           # The project description, installation, and usage guide
    
3. Choosing a License (MIT is Recommended)
A license tells others how they can use your code. Without one, default copyright law means no one can use it.
License	Simple Explanation	Recommendation
MIT License	"You can do whatever you want, just keep my name and this license file."	This is your best choice for a first project. It's simple and permissive.
Apache 2.0	Similar to MIT, but includes rules about stating changes and patent rights.	Great for larger, more corporate-friendly projects.
GPLv3	"If you use my code, your project must also be open-source under GPL."	Use when you want to ensure derivatives of your work remain free and open.
4. The Two Core Workflows: clone vs. init
Your starting method depends on where the project is created first.
•	Path A: git clone (Project created on GitHub first)
1.	Create the repository on GitHub.com (with a README, license, etc.).
2.	On your computer, navigate to your dev folder: cd ~/dev.
3.	Clone the repository to your machine: git clone <your-repo-url>.
4.	This automatically creates the folder, downloads the files, and links to the remote.
•	Path B: git init (Project created on your computer first)
1.	On your computer, create a new project folder: mkdir new-project && cd new-project.
2.	Turn it into a Git repository: git init.
3.	Create an empty repository on GitHub.com (no README or license).
4.	Link your local repo to GitHub: git remote add origin <your-repo-url>.
5.	Push for the first time: git push -u origin main.
5. Solving Common Problems
Git Ignoring Empty Folders (The .gitkeep Trick)
•	Problem: git add . and git commit do nothing for newly created empty folders (src, docs, etc.).
•	Reason: Git tracks file content, not empty directories.
•	Solution: Add an empty placeholder file inside the directory. The convention is to name it .gitkeep.
Generated bash
      touch src/.gitkeep
touch docs/.gitkeep
    
Now, Git will see these new files and allow you to commit the folder structure.
Pushing to GitHub for the First Time
•	Problem: A simple git push might not work, even if commits are made.
•	Reason: Your local main branch doesn't know it's supposed to be linked to the main branch on the remote (origin).
•	Solution: Use the -u (--set-upstream) flag on your first push.
Generated bash
      git push -u origin main
    
This command does two things: pushes your changes AND creates the tracking link. For all future pushes on that branch, you can simply use git push.
6. Branching - The "Tracing Paper" Analogy
•	main branch: The Master Blueprint. It should always be stable and working.
•	New Branch: A sheet of tracing paper laid over the blueprint. You can add new features or fix bugs here without affecting the master.
Workflow:
1.	Create a branch: git checkout -b <new-feature-name>
2.	Do your work: Make changes, add files.
3.	Commit your work: git add . and git commit -m "..."
4.	Return to main: git checkout main
5.	Merge your work: git merge <new-feature-name>
6.	Push the updated main: git push origin main
7.	(Optional) Delete the feature branch: git branch -d <new-feature-name>
7. Pull Requests (PRs) - The Collaboration Hub
A Pull Request is a formal request to merge one branch into another on GitHub. It's a place for code review and discussion.
Workflow:
1.	Create and push a branch as described above (git push -u origin <new-feature-name>).
2.	Go to GitHub. A banner will appear prompting you to "Compare & pull request".
3.	Create the PR: Give it a clear title and a detailed description explaining why you made the changes.
4.	Review: Use the "Files Changed" tab to see the additions (green) and deletions (red). Team members can comment on specific lines.
5.	Merge: Once approved, click the "Merge pull request" button on GitHub.
6.	Clean up: Delete the branch on GitHub and update your local repository (git checkout main, git pull, git branch -d <new-feature-name>).
8. The VS Code Workflow
VS Code provides a powerful visual interface for all Git operations.
1.	Install Extensions: "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and "GitLens".
2.	Create Branch: Click the branch name in the bottom-left corner and select + Create new branch....
3.	Stage Changes: In the "Source Control" sidebar, click the + icon next to files you want to stage (git add).
4.	Commit: Type your message in the box at the top of the Source Control panel and click the checkmark (git commit).
5.	Push Branch: Click the "Publish Branch" button (git push -u ...).
6.	Create PR: Go to the "GitHub" sidebar and click "Create Pull Request". Fill out the form inside VS Code.
7.	Review & Merge: Use the same GitHub sidebar to review open PRs, see file changes, and click the "Merge" button.
